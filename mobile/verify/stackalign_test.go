// core.StackAlign on the two natives.
//
// The property is the per-layer opt-out from core.ZStack's centre-on-both-axes
// contract, and it is the one placement prop in the framework that all four
// renderers honour — the flexbox AlignSelf beside it is read by the two DOM
// targets alone. That is the whole reason it exists as a type of its own, so a
// native arm quietly missing is the failure that would undo it.
//
// The failure is silent in the way this package's checks always are: a value
// with no arm falls to `default`/`else`, which returns nil, which means "leave
// this layer where the stack put it". So a layer asking for the top-left
// corner sits in the middle on a phone and in the corner in a browser, and
// nothing errors anywhere.
//
// See switchlabels_test.go for the parse and why it is one.
